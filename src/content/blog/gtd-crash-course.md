Existing as an adult in this world means dealing with a lot of "stuff."
We deal with paperwork, obligations, errands, and lots of people.
Juggling this stuff in our brain drains us and makes us ineffective.

> The brain is for having ideas, not keeping them.
-- David Allen, _Getting Things Done_

The Getting Things Done system solves this with a set of lists and folders,
and a process for filing things into them.
Let's say you got a bill in the mail. It isn't urgent, but it needs to be taken
care of. What do you do?

## The first question: Is it actionable?

- If it isn't actionable: You can trash it, or you can save it in a reference
  filing system, which I'll cover later.

- If it _is_ actionable: Decide on the _next action_. What's the next _immediate,
  observable thing_ that you need to do to resolve this?
  This bill needs to be paid. Is that done online, over the phone, or by mail?
  Do you know the phone number, or website, or address?
  Figure that out _now_.




- Projects
- Project support material
- Calendar actions and information
- Next actions
- Stuff you're waiting for
- Reference material
- Stuff you might do "someday, maybe"

These could be items in categories in a to-do app, pages in folders in a file
cabinet, whatever.
As long as you can make lists and folders, you can implement GTD.
