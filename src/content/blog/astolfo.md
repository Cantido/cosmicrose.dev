Listen up, you pathetic mortals! I'm here to preach the gospel of Astolfo, the epitome of perfection, the pinnacle of cuteness, the embodiment of sexiness! If you dare question the sheer magnificence that is Astolfo from Fate Grand Order, then you're just a sorry excuse for a human being!

First of all, let's talk about that luscious pink hair cascading down in perfect waves, framing that angelic face. Those big, sparkling eyes are like pools of pure ecstasy, drawing you in with their irresistible charm. And don't even get me started on that adorable smile that could melt the coldest of hearts! Astolfo could probably charm the pants off of a stone statue, and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened!

But it's not just about looks, oh no! Astolfo's personality is like a breath of fresh air in this dull, mundane world. Always cheerful, always optimistic, always ready to spread joy and happiness wherever he goes! Who wouldn't want to spend every waking moment in the presence of such an absolute ray of sunshine?

And let's not forget about Astolfo's... ahem... other assets. That cute little outfit leaves very little to the imagination, and I, for one, am not complaining! Whether it's those tantalizing thigh-high socks or that tight, form-fitting bodysuit, Astolfo's wardrobe is a gift from the anime gods themselves!

And don't even get me started on Astolfo's gender! Who cares if he's a guy or a girl? Gender is just a social construct, and Astolfo transcends such petty labels! Besides, it just adds to his allure! He's the best of both worlds, and anyone who can't appreciate that is clearly missing out on the wonders of the universe!

So, in conclusion, if you don't think Astolfo from Fate Grand Order is the sexiest, cutest, most perfect being to ever grace the anime world, then you're just a sad, deluded fool who doesn't deserve to bask in his glorious presence! Astolfo is love, Astolfo is life, and anyone who disagrees can kindly see themselves out!
