About four years ago, I abandoned social media. I had developed some unhealthy
habits and I decided the feeds were not for me. But then, the 2020 election
season started, and I wanted to stay informed. I tried Reddit, and found that
it was a healthier way for me to stay informed without the doom-scrolling and
parasocial relationships that made Twitter bad for me. Thus I learned
that following topics, not individuals, was the healthier choice.


Reddit started
circling the drain, so I bailed for Lemmy, the Fediverse's answer to Reddit.
I have learned that
federation is a weapon for
fighting enshittification of the internet by robbing any centralized service
of the power to control the information we see and the people we associate with.

I have been a certified Lemmy enjoyer for more than a year now.


While scrolling my Lemmy feed one day last week, it finally clicked for me:
an RSS feed is no different from any other social media feed.
So much of social media is sharing content on other sites, so why don't I just
follow those sites directly?

I installed FreshRSS on my network, and set up a few feeds. Then I
got my clients up and running: NetNewsWire on my phone, a pinned tab to my
FreshRSS instance in my browser, and newsboat in my terminal (just for fun).
Then I set about collecting feeds. As it turns out, maybe twenty percent of the
content in my feed came from a source that supported RSS, and the remaining
were original content.
That's great for filling my RSS reader with content I might enjoy,
but if I'm trying to disengage more from social media,
that is not a very large fraction.

With [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/), the rest of the world opens up to RSS.
It's a decentralized service that adapts the feed from a wide variety of
websites into RSS feeds. I'm using their
[RSSHub Radar Firefox Add-on](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub-Radar), which
also has an integration with FreshRSS for easy subscribing.




RSS is fundamental technology for keeping the internet decentralized.
