Despite being over twenty years old, _The Pragmatic Programmer_, by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt, still contains a lot of valuable advice for folks in our industry.
I've been a professional programmer for half as long as this book has been out, but I've never read it.
Recently, I set out to change that, and have been thoroughly studying this thing.
I've even been taking notes.
In my next several blog posts, I'm going to be writing about my impressions from this book, one chapter at a time.

## You Have Agency

The first chapter of the book is titled "A Pragmatic Philosophy," and introduces the authors' mindsets for the rest of the book.
Being pragmatic means having the bigger picture in mind.
The chapter contains an inspiring tip:

> You have agency.

Over my career, I have gotten excited about many things.
When I get excited, it consumes me (thanks ADHD).
I want to change the world.
Unfortunately, even the smallest organizations take time to adapt to change.
After struggling to push for positive change at several jobs over my ten-year career, I've become a little jaded.
This chapter was refreshing, and it reminded me that there is plenty of stuff I have control over.

## Fix Broken Windows

What stood out to me in this chapter was advice to not allow "broken windows" in the projects you're responsible for.
The analogy comes from a March 1982 article by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling that claimed

> Social psychologists and police officers tend to agree that if a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired, all the rest of the windows will soon be broken.
> [...] one un-repaired broken window is a sign that no one cares, and so breaking more windows costs nothing.

This inspired some terrible policing practices, but in the much more mundane world of software development, I can appreciate the analogy.
In a messy codebase, it is easy to think that no one cares about its quality.
However, remember the tip from earlier: You have agency!
You can improve things!

## Invest In Your Skills

Your knowledge & skills are fundamental to your career, so you should build on them regularly.
Here the authors make an analogy with financial investing:

1. Invest regularly - make it a habit to learn new things
2. Diversify - learn a mix of things
3. Manage risk - balance practical skills with interesting opportunities
4. Buy low, sell high - learn risky emerging technologies that may get big someday
5. Review & rebalance - recognize when stuff you've learned has become obsolete

It also gives some direct advice, like:

1. Learn one new programming language per year
2. Read one technical book per month
3. Read non-technical stuff, too
4. Take classes
5. Participate in local users groups & meetups
6. Experiment with different development environments
7. Stay current

I will be doing a few of these things for 2025.
The jury is still out on what language I'm going to learn, but it's been a couple of years since I've picked up a new one.
This blog post is a result of me taking the reading recommendation seriously, as well.

## When Communicating: Know Your Audience

I struggle with communication.
In person, I'm fairly reserved, frequently spending too much time thinking about what I'll say next, and by the time I know what I'm going to say, the conversation has moved on.
On the other hand, when I have the opportunity to talk about something that excites me, I ramble, follow tangents, and generally confuse people.
The third section of this chapter gives solid advice for any form of communication: know your audience.
Understand your audience's priorities.
Get their feedback on your early drafts.
Involve them in the conversation, even if you're presenting to them.
It's excellent advice, and I'm trying to internalize it.
