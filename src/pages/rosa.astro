    <h1>About Rosa</h1>

    <p>
    My name is <span property="givenName">Rosa</span>.
    I'm a
    <span property="jobTitle">software developer</span>
    in
    <span property="address" typeof="PostalAddress">

      My hobbies are generally technical but only sometimes related to computers.
      During most of my free time, I write silly little programs, chasing my whimsy and trying to learn more about the protocols, tools, algorithms, data structures and other things that computers use to form the foundation of modern life.
      I do this on an Arch Linux PC and a handful of machines I host myself and frequently tinker on. I've gotten decent at administrating Linux machines.
      I'm also a licensed amateur radio operator with the callsign <span property="callSign">KEâˆ…VTF</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Besides tech, I love anime, and I would be delighted to give you recommendations.

      I've been a programmer for more than ten years.
      In that time, I've built a lot of cool things.
      Stuff I've done for work can be found on my resume.
      Here are some things I made for fun:

    I believe that software, automation, and the Internet can give us the power to do a lot of good.
    My favorite projects are the kind that liberate data and make it available to the world.
    Public APIs and open protocols contribute to a better world.
    <p>

    <p>
      Open-source licenses, especially copyleft licenses, make for better software.
      That's why I use copyleft licenses on the software I write.
    </p>

    <p>
      I advocate for privacy in the digital world because I believe privacy is a human right.
      Decentralized, federated, and self-hosted digital services are the key to preserving this right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trans rights are human rights.
